<h2>What the Hell is a "Nebelung?"</h2>




<p>Nebelungs are a breed of cat. A breed you probably never heard of before. I think they stopped making Nebelungs when someone realized how clumsy and annoying and stupid they are.</p>

<p>I mentioned to Russ that I was thinking about getting a cat. He said "I know a guy who's cat just had kittens." So I thought about it and I figured "why not take a chance on the universe and say yes? What's the worst that could happen?"</p>




<p>So, one day I drove over and some guy named Curtis handed me a box out in the parking lot behind the dumpster. Inside the box were a couple kittens They looked normal, more or less, so I took them home.</p> <p>Big mistake. I started noticing problems almost immediately. Right from the beginning I could see signs that something wasn't right. They'd try to hide it, sure. But, I was patient and watched. I learned their rhythms and their patterns. I saw what piqued their interest. I grew to know them and all I can say is they are pure evil.</p>
