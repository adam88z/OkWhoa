    <p>I managed numerous web sites, mostly  for medical departments at The University of Pittsburgh. These sites were built to showcase the academic and research missions of institutions  within the School of Medicine and served as recruitment tools to attract physicians to train and practice in Pittsburgh.</p>
    <img src="~/Content/images/experience/UPMC_DSC_3071.jpg" class="experienceFigureLeft" alt="UPMC Presbyterian">
<p> Many of these sites were built in the early days of the web and required a great deal of effort to keep updated due to their antiquated architecture. Approximately 35% of my effort went into keeping these sites maintained and updated, with the rest of my time spent constructing new sites.</p>

    <p><strong>Department of Anesthesiology</strong><!--<a href="http://www.anes.upmc.edu/"></a>--> - Redesigned and rebuilt the website as an ASP.NET app. In addition to the development, I was responsible for all aspects of this site including a great deal of the photography. I developed the Flash banner that appears at the top of the splash page and I wrote code to automate the process of posting personnel pages, news stories, and upcoming events.</p>

    <!-- Project - ERMI -->

    -->
    <img class="experienceFigureLeft" src="~/Content/images/experience/UPMC-ERMI.jpg" alt="Anesthesiology website">

    <p><a href="https://www.emergencyresourcemanagement.com/"><strong>Emergency Resource Management, Inc.</strong></a> - Designed and built new internal and external sites. ERMI is a non-profit affiliate of UPMC that provides emergency medical staffing to emergency rooms and urgent care facilities across Western Pennsylvania. The site serves as the primary recruiting tool for medical personnel and therefore had to reflect a high degree of professionalism.</p>

    <img class="experienceFigureLeft" src="~/Content/images/experience/UPMC-MIRM_150.jpg" alt="McGowan Institute website">

    <p><a href="http://www.MIRM.upmc.edu/"><strong>McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine</strong></a> - Maintained, expanded and enhanced many portions of this large and complex site. The McGowan Institue is known worldwide for cutting-edge research and development of regenerative medicine and therapeutic techniques. </p>
