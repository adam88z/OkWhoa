            <h2>Freelance Web Developer</h2>
            <p>You might be looking for a consultant, a designer, a developer, someone who can help you design and build an outstanding web experience.</p>
            <p>I may be able to assist you.</p>



            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">I'm Unique</h2>
            <h5>(Just Like Everybody Else)</h5>
            <p>My skills combine well to produce web experiences which look great and work the way they should.</p>

            <p>I know the difference between typefaces and fonts. I know  x-heights, kerning, ligatures, expert sets, and web fonts.</p>
            <p>I am pathologically obsessive... In a good way.  I catch things others might miss. I know all those tedious details about proper English and when to use a comma or a semicolon or, perhaps even the occasional smiley face.</p>
            <p>Of, course, nobody cares about that stuff anymore so, if you don't appreciate competence and don't particularly want something special then, you should have no problem finding that.</p>

            <p>Before I was a web geek I was the Senior Media Producer for the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Originally I was responsible for preparing presentation materials for the Department of Surgery. I would, on a daily basis produce oftentimes hundreds of slides (actual slides&#8230; on Ektachrome) as well as a variety of presentations, posters, brochures, newsletters and whatever else was needed to satisfy the needs of some of the most demanding people on Earth (You think Simon Cowell is rough? Try 120 professors of surgery).</p>

            <h2>Pretty Pictures</h2>
            <p>Stock photography is everywhere and it does look great. The only problem is that people recognize when they are looking at stock photography and it can be interpreted as insincere. People respond a lot better when your site's photography actually reflects you and your people and products. Not many other web developers can provide anything like the capabilities I offer. Not many web developers are professional studio photographers. Even fewer can produce top-notch broadcast-quality HD video and audio. </p>

            <h2>Mrs. Pasquale</h2>
            <p>Mrs. Pasquale was my high school English teacher. The effect of her instruction led me to become one of those people who lives by "Strunk & White" and "The Chicago Manual of Style".  Why is this important?  Because with me you get a resource who is likely to catch and correct all the little grammatical inconsistencies that could otherwise slip through and detract from your message and your image.</p>

            <h2>Trees?</h2>
            <img src="../Content/images/aboutme/tree2.jpg" class="aboutMeFigureRight clearRight"">
            <p>For some reason I have always liked climbing trees.
                <!--This is a photo of me at age 6 being rescued from a tree by a Wilkinsburg fire fighter. The picture ran on the front page of the Post-Gazette and I had my 15 minutes of fame. Maybe that explains why. -->
                I enjoy the view I guess. Most of the times when you climb a tree you are the first person to ever enjoy that particular view. Some folks enjoy wingsuit flying and base-jumping. I'm into real danger--I climb trees. I am very well-trained as a climber and always practice industry-approved safety procedures. Climbing is fun. Falling... not so much.</p>
