    <h2>Fairbanks, Alaska</h2>

    <h4>Night Manager</h4>

    <p>IEC was a heating oil distributor that served the area in and around Fairbanks. I held the title of Night Manager and was responsible for coordinating and dispatching a fleet of drivers. Nights in Fairbanks were long and cold but, there were advantages to being in radio contact with a group of drivers in the heart of Alaska in the middle of the night--they would call in anytime the Northern Lights started to really put on a spectacular show.</p>

    <p>During my shift I often pitched in and helped with reconciling customer's accounts. I created several programs that assisted with tracking and managing customer records.</p>
