    <p>I was assigned to support SR-71 Blackbirds, U2 Dragon Ladies, KC-135 Stratotankers, and T-38 Talons at Beale Air Force Base. My mission was to maintain, repair and upgrade instrumentation and flight-control systems. The SR-71 in particular was an aircraft unique in every respect which required learning and developing skills unrelated to all other aircraft. The Engineer who invented and developed the aircraft, Kelly Johnson, offered $50.00 to anyone who could name a single component on the aircraft that didn't have to be invented specifically for the SR-71. No one ever claimed the $50.00.</p>

    <p>Support for this platform often required deployment to forward operating areas such as Kadena, Japan; Mildenhall, England; and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. The mission required Secret security clearance for all personnel associated with maintenance and operations.</p>

    <p>Support of the U2 Reconnaisance mission required deployment to Osan Air Base in South Korea.</p>

    <p>I accepted an assignment to support T-33 Shooting Star, HH-53 Jolly Green Giant and JC-130H "Satellite Catcher" aircraft at Hickam Air Force Base Hawaii. I was chosen to participate in an "incentive flight" program by my base commander and was fortunate enough to "slip the surly bonds of Earth" in a single-engine jet fighter where I was permitted to pilot the aircraft for a portion of the sortie--a rare priviledge. During this assignment I was selected to serve in the Honor Guard that received Ronald Reagan during his trip to China.</p>
